# Project: Student Management System

### Libraries: PyQT6 & SqLite3

This application creates a GUI that allows users to view data from the database, create new entries for new students, 
and search for existing students. 
The GUI uses OOP to create the overall app GUI, handle data extraction and posting, and the functions
